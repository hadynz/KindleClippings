EEG readouts measured while test subjects practise Focused Attention show that these techniques enliven gamma brain waves in the left prefrontal cortex, the brain’s decision maker. This means that the electrical activity in the brain reaches a frequency per second of about 20 to 50 hertz (Hz), or cycles per second. You see a similar result when a student concentrates on a mathematical problem – which makes sense, because gamma waves are found when one is engaged in a challenging task. In contrast to attempting to clear the mind of thoughts, the second category of meditation, Open Monitoring, also known as mindfulness, is about learning to observe thoughts dispassionately, without judgement, as they come and go. This is because thoughts themselves are not seen as the potential disrupter of calm, but rather it is the content or meaning of thoughts that can disrupt.
